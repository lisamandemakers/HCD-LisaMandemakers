            <p tabindex="0">In truth, the present philippic is as necessary to the completeness of
                the whole of Nietzsche’s system as the keystone is to the arch. All the
                curves of his speculation lead up to it. What he flung himself against,
                from beginning to end of his days of writing, was always, in the last
                analysis, Christianity in some form or other—Christianity as a system
                of practical ethics, Christianity as a political code, Christianity as
                meta<span class="pagenum" title="Page 12"> </span><a id="Page_12"></a>physics, Christianity as a gauge of the truth. It would be
                difficult to think of any intellectual enterprise on his long list that
                did not, more or less directly and clearly, relate itself to this master
                enterprise of them all. It was as if his <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber’s note: Original read ‘apostacy.’">apostasy</ins> from the
                faith of his fathers, filling him with the fiery zeal of the convert,
                and particularly of the convert to heresy, had blinded him to every
                other element in the gigantic self-delusion of civilized man. The will
                to power was his answer to Christianity’s affectation of humility and
                self-sacrifice; eternal recurrence was his mocking criticism of
                Christian optimism and millennialism; the superman was his candidate for
                the place of the Christian ideal of the “good” man, prudently abased
                before the throne of God. The things he chiefly argued for were
                anti-Christian things—the abandonment of the purely moral view of life,
                the rehabilitation of instinct, the dethronement of weakness and
                timidity as ideals, the renunciation of the whole hocus-pocus of
                dogmatic religion, the extermination of false aristocracies (of the
                priest, of the politician, of the plutocrat), the revival of the
                healthy, lordly “innocence” that was Greek. If he was anything in a
                word, Nietzsche was a Greek born two thousand<span class="pagenum" title="Page 13"> </span><a id="Page_13"></a> years too late. His
                dreams were thoroughly Hellenic; his whole manner of thinking was
                Hellenic; his peculiar errors were Hellenic no less. But his Hellenism,
                I need not add, was anything but the pale neo-Platonism that has run
                like a thread through the thinking of the Western world since the days
                of the Christian Fathers. From Plato, to be sure, he got what all of us
                must get, but his real forefather was Heraclitus. It is in Heraclitus
                that one finds the germ of his primary view of the universe—a view, to
                wit, that sees it, not as moral phenomenon, but as mere aesthetic
                representation. The God that Nietzsche imagined, in the end, was not far
                from the God that such an artist as Joseph Conrad imagines—a supreme
                craftsman, ever experimenting, ever coming closer to an ideal balancing
                of lines and forces, and yet always failing to work out the final
                harmony.</p>
                <p tabindex="0">The late war, awakening all the primitive racial fury of the Western
                nations, and therewith all their ancient enthusiasm for religious taboos
                and sanctions, naturally focused attention upon Nietzsche, as upon the
                most daring and provocative of recent amateur theologians. The Germans,
                with their characteristic tendency to ex<span class="pagenum" title="Page 14"> </span><a id="Page_14"></a>plain their every act in terms
                as realistic and unpleasant as possible, appear to have mauled him in a
                belated and unexpected embrace, to the horror, I daresay, of the Kaiser,
                and perhaps to the even greater horror of Nietzsche’s own ghost. The
                folks of Anglo-Saxondom, with their equally characteristic tendency to
                explain all their enterprises romantically, simultaneously set him up as
                the Antichrist he no doubt secretly longed to be. The result was a great
                deal of misrepresentation and misunderstanding of him. From the pulpits
                of the allied countries, and particularly from those of England and the
                United States, a horde of patriotic ecclesiastics denounced him in
                extravagant terms as the author of all the horrors of the time, and in
                the newspapers, until the Kaiser was elected sole bugaboo, he shared the
                honors of that office with von Hindenburg, the Crown Prince, Capt.
                Boy-Ed, von Bernstorff and von Tirpitz. Most of this denunciation, of
                course, was frankly idiotic—the naïve pishposh of suburban Methodists,
                notoriety-seeking college professors, almost illiterate editorial
                writers, and other such numskulls. In much of it, including not a few
                official hymns of hate, Nietzsche was gravely discovered to be the
                teacher of such<span class="pagenum" title="Page 15"> </span><a id="Page_15"></a> spokesmen of the extremest sort of German nationalism
                as von Bernhardi and von Treitschke—which was just as intelligent as
                making George Bernard Shaw the mentor of Lloyd-George. In other solemn
                pronunciamentoes he was credited with being philosophically responsible
                for various imaginary crimes of the enemy—the wholesale slaughter or
                mutilation of prisoners of war, the deliberate burning down of Red Cross
                hospitals, the utilization of the corpses of the slain for soap-making.
                I amused myself, in those gaudy days, by collecting newspaper clippings
                to this general effect, and later on I shall probably publish a digest
                of them, as a contribution to the study of war hysteria. The thing went
                to unbelievable lengths. On the strength of the fact that I had
                published a book on Nietzsche in 1906, six years after his death, I was
                called upon by agents of the Department of Justice, elaborately
                outfitted with badges, to meet the charge that I was an intimate
                associate and agent of “the German monster, Nietzsky.” I quote the
                official <i>procès verbal</i>, an indignant but often misspelled document.
                Alas, poor Nietzsche! After all his laborious efforts to prove that he
                was not a German, but a Pole—even<span class="pagenum" title="Page 16"> </span><a id="Page_16"></a> after his heroic readiness, via
                anti-anti-Semitism, to meet the deduction that, if a Pole, then probably
                also a Jew!</p>
                <p tabindex="0">But under all this alarmed and preposterous tosh there was at least a
                sound instinct, and that was the instinct which recognized Nietzsche as
                the most eloquent, pertinacious and effective of all the critics of the
                philosophy to which the Allies against Germany stood committed, and on
                the strength of which, at all events in theory, the United States had
                engaged itself in the war. He was not, in point of fact, involved with
                the visible enemy, save in remote and transient ways; the German,
                officially, remained the most ardent of Christians during the war and
                became a democrat at its close. But he was plainly a foe of democracy in
                all its forms, political, religious and epistemological, and what is
                worse, his opposition was set forth in terms that were not only
                extraordinarily penetrating and devastating, but also uncommonly
                offensive. It was thus quite natural that he should have aroused a
                degree of indignation verging upon the pathological in the two countries
                that had planted themselves upon the democratic platform most boldly,
                and that felt it most shaky, one may add, under their feet.<span class="pagenum" title="Page 17"> </span><a id="Page_17"></a> I daresay
                that Nietzsche, had he been alive, would have got a lot of satisfaction
                out of the execration thus heaped upon him, not only because, being a
                vain fellow, he enjoyed execration as a tribute to his general
                singularity, and hence to his superiority, but also and more importantly
                because, being no mean psychologist, he would have recognized the
                disconcerting doubts underlying it. If Nietzsche’s criticism of
                democracy were as ignorant and empty, say, as the average evangelical
                clergyman’s criticism of Darwin’s hypothesis of natural selection, then
                the advocates of democracy could afford to dismiss it as loftily as the
                Darwinians dismiss the blather of the holy clerks. And if his attack
                upon Christianity were mere sound and fury, signifying nothing, then
                there would be no call for anathemas from the sacred desk. But these
                onslaughts, in point of fact, have behind them a tremendous learning and
                a great deal of point and plausibility—there are, in brief, bullets in
                the gun, teeth in the tiger,—and so it is no wonder that they excite
                the ire of men who hold, as a primary article of belief, that their
                acceptance would destroy civilization, darken the sun, and bring Jahveh
                to sobs upon His Throne.</p>
                <p tabindex="0"><span class="pagenum" title="Page 18"> </span><a id="Page_18"></a>But in all this justifiable fear, of course, there remains a false
                assumption, and that is the assumption that Nietzsche proposed to
                destroy Christianity altogether, and so rob the plain people of the
                world of their virtue, their spiritual consolations, and their hope of
                heaven. Nothing could be more untrue. The fact is that Nietzsche had no
                interest whatever in the delusions of the plain people—that is,
                intrinsically. It seemed to him of small moment <i>what</i> they believed, so
                long as it was safely imbecile. What he stood against was not their
                beliefs, but the elevation of those beliefs, by any sort of democratic
                process, to the dignity of a state philosophy—what he feared most was
                the pollution and crippling of the superior minority by intellectual
                disease from below. His plain aim in “The Antichrist” was to combat that
                menace by completing the work begun, on the one hand, by Darwin and the
                other evolutionist philosophers, and, on the other hand, by German
                historians and philologians. The net effect of this earlier attack, in
                the eighties, had been the collapse of Christian theology as a serious
                concern of educated men. The mob, it must be obvious, was very little
                shaken; even to this day it has not put<span class="pagenum" title="Page 19"> </span><a id="Page_19"></a> off its belief in the essential
                Christian doctrines. But the <i>intelligentsia</i>, by 1885, had been pretty
                well convinced. No man of sound information, at the time Nietzsche
                planned “The Antichrist,” actually believed that the world was created
                in seven days, or that its fauna was once overwhelmed by a flood as a
                penalty for the sins of man, or that Noah saved the boa constrictor, the
                prairie dog and the <i>pediculus capitis</i> by taking a pair of each into
                the ark, or that Lot’s wife was turned into a pillar of salt, or that a
                fragment of the True Cross could cure hydrophobia. Such notions, still
                almost universally prevalent in Christendom a century before, were now
                confined to the great body of ignorant and credulous men—that is, to
                ninety-five or ninety-six percent. of the race. For a man of the
                superior minority to subscribe to one of them publicly was already
                sufficient to set him off as one in imminent need of psychiatrical
                attention. Belief in them had become a mark of inferiority, like the
                allied belief in madstones, magic and apparitions.</p>
                <p tabindex="0">But though the theology of Christianity had thus sunk to the lowly
                estate of a mere delusion of the rabble, propagated on that level by the
                ancient caste of sacerdotal parasites, the ethics<span class="pagenum" title="Page 20"> </span><a id="Page_20"></a> of Christianity
                continued to enjoy the utmost acceptance, and perhaps even more
                acceptance than ever before. It seemed to be generally felt, in fact,
                that they simply <i>must</i> be saved from the wreck—that the world would
                vanish into chaos if they went the way of the revelations supporting
                them. In this fear a great many judicious men joined, and so there arose
                what was, in essence, an absolutely new Christian cult—a cult, to wit,
                purged of all the supernaturalism superimposed upon the older cult by
                generations of theologians, and harking back to what was conceived to be
                the pure ethical doctrine of Jesus. This cult still flourishes;
                Protestantism tends to become identical with it; it invades Catholicism
                as Modernism; it is supported by great numbers of men whose intelligence
                is manifest and whose sincerity is not open to question. Even Nietzsche
                himself yielded to it in weak moments, as you will discover on examining
                his somewhat laborious effort to make Paul the villain of Christian
                theology, and Jesus no more than an innocent bystander. But this
                sentimental yielding never went far enough to distract his attention for
                long from his main idea, which was this: that Christian ethics were
                quite as dubious, at bot<span class="pagenum" title="Page 21"> </span><a id="Page_21"></a>tom, as Christian theology—that they were
                founded, just as surely as such childish fables as the story of Jonah
                and the whale, upon the peculiar prejudices and credulities, the special
                desires and appetites, of inferior men—that they warred upon the best
                interests of men of a better sort quite as unmistakably as the most
                extravagant of objective superstitions. In brief, what he saw in
                Christian ethics, under all the poetry and all the fine show of altruism
                and all the theoretical benefits therein, was a democratic effort to
                curb the egoism of the strong—a conspiracy of the <i>chandala</i> against
                the free functioning of their superiors, nay, against the free progress
                of mankind. This theory is the thing he exposes in “The Antichrist,”
                bringing to the business his amazingly chromatic and exigent eloquence
                at its finest flower. This is the “conspiracy” he sets forth in all the
                panoply of his characteristic italics, dashes, <i>sforzando</i> interjections
                and exclamation points.</p>
